        Currently studying computer science for the first year at the Lebanese American University, coding has been my passion since youth. From around 15, my desire for creating mobile games has intrigued me to try and learn unity and C#. This was my gateway to the wonderful world of programming and problem-solving. My interests then shifted to the world of web programming. Along the way, I've picked up many languages such as Python, Dart, and JavaScript. In addition, I've learned many frameworks like Django, Flutter, React and React Native. Iâ€™ve worked on many projects and joined quite a few coding contests. In 2021, I've won the first prize of the web development contest by LAU.
